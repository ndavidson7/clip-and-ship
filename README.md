# clip-to-yt

## TODO:
- investigate why Rust returned only 8 clips, while other games would correctly return 10
- insert_to_playlist() needs to be delayed (maybe?) to account for YouTube not recognizing the video_id immediately after uploading (i.e., YT has to process the upload first?)
- generate_tags()
- add argument for manager uploading mode
